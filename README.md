# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is a simple neural network model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. It was created as an assignment for the IT3273 Machine Learning Lab at IIEST Shibpur.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which is included in the repository as `Titanic data.csv`.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn

## Model

The model is a feedforward neural network with the following architecture:

- Dense layer with 64 units and ReLU activation
- Dense layer with 32 units and ReLU activation
- Dense layer with 1 unit and sigmoid activation

## Evaluation

The model achieved an accuracy of 84% on the training set and 82% on the test set.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
2. Open the provided Jupyter notebook in the Jupyter environment and run the cells to train and evaluate the model.
